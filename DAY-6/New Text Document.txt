DAY-6
PYTHON FUNCTIONS AND KAREL
refer python documentation for all kind of built in functions
print,len,sum,max,etc etc are can be stated as built in functions
To define a function we use def keyword
like 
def hello():
	print("Hello")
like this we will create and use functions
It helps in code reusability.
if we write a program for an function and that program is very useful in all the program then we create a function which can be called when ever it needs
What is function calling function calling is the process which helps to reuse the code which has been used once.
In this day we use Reeborgs world.
We can use functions in loops which will be very use full.
As we know that loops are the elements which can be used to iterate a particular function 
repeatedly
Indentation:This is one of the fundamental in python every code must follow indentation.
for example
if x>2:
    print("hello")
the black space can be called as indentation.
