This simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game is created using Python's random module. The game allows the user to play against the computer in an interactive loop. The available choices—rock, paper, and scissors—are stored in a list. The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the computer randomly selects one from the list. The game then compares the choices to determine the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both choices are the same, it's a tie. The game continues in a loop until the user decides to quit by typing "quit." This program is an easy way to practice using loops, conditionals, and the random module in Python.
