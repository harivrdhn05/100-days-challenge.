day-5-Starting with loops
we use loops for itrative statments.
we create it for repeating particular statement number of times we need
we have different types 
we have different types of inbuilt functions in python like sum() and avg() and all 
these all are number friendly inbuilt functions which helps us to avoid huge code.They are used to make sum or find average or fing minimum or maximum.
We use these functions to reduce the complexity and to reduce the loops.
For example let us consider an array 
arr=[12,13,10,9,15,17,13]
To find the sum in traditional method we write
for number in arr:
	number += number
but we can even use sum function 
even we can use maximum function to find the maximum value in it
Range:
We use range option frequently which is very useful and helpful in programing
It is used to interate the particular block or a code in certain number of lines.
example 1:
arr=[12,13,10,9,15,17,13]
for i in range(0,3):
	print(arr[i])
example 2:
for number in range(1,101):
	total *= number
print(total)

TASK 1:
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
But when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

*Error* 
I have used "/" instead of %
and also i have replaced the positions of FizzBuzz this is the main error 
so when i kept fizz buzz in the first or if condition then i have no error in the code
*code*:
for number in range(1,101):
    if number%3==0 and number%5==0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number%5==0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif number%3==0:     
        print("Fizz")
    else:
        print(number)
Day project we have:
 Day 5 Project: Creating a Password Generator
create a password generator which takes the input form the user like how many characters you want.
we use symbols also in it
We use a module name called "random" which allows us to generate random elements from the 
give data set.
First objective for code is to give the data set.
letters = [
    'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z',
    'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'
]

symbols = ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')', '_', '+']

numbers = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']
this is the data set
